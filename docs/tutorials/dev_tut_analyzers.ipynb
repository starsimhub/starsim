    "## Reporting results\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Starsim module can have its own results, which get added to the full list of results in the Sim object. For example, the `ss.Pregnancy` module adds results like `sim.results.pregnancy.pregnant`, and the `ss.HIV` module adds results like `sim.results.hiv.new_infections`. If you are writing your own module, you can add whatever custom results you want. However, another option is to create an `Analyzer` to store results that you might need for one particular analysis but won't need all the time. An `Analyzer` is very similar to other Starsim modules in its structure, but the general idea of an analyzer is that it gets called at the end of a timestep, and reports of the state of things after everything else has been updated without changing any of the module states itself.\n"

For example, if you wanted to know the number of connections in the network on each timestep, you could write a small analyzer as follows:"

    "Is that what you expected it to look like? The reason it looks like that is that initially, agents die (either from aging or from disease), reducing the number of edges. New agents are being born, but they don't participate in male-female networks until the age of debut -- which is 15 years old by default, which is why the trend reverses (and tracks population size) after 2015. This illustrates the importance of model burn-in!"
