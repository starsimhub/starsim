    "\n",
    "The basic template for modeling a disease in Starsim is the `Disease` class. Much like sims or networks, a `Disease` can be customized by passing in a `pars` dictionary containing parameters. The `Disease` module does lots of different things, but three of the model fundamental are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `set_initial_states`, which initializes people into states (e.g. susceptible, infected, recovered)\n",
    "- `make_new_cases`, which makes new cases (e.g., by finding the susceptible contacts of all infected people and calculating the probability of transmission for each)\n",
    "- `set_prognoses`, which sets the outcomes for people who get infected (e.g., by setting their date of recovery or death).\n"

    "## Making your own disease\n",
    "If you want to make your own disease, you could either inherit from one of the templates in diseases.py, or you could copy the examples and extend them to capture features of the disease that you want to model. For example, suppose you wanted to change the SIR model to an SEIR model (i.e., add an 'exposed' state where people were transmissible but did not yet have symptoms. You might hope that this would be a relatively simple change to make. Here's how it would look:"
