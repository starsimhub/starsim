    "Many infectious diseases transmit when people come into contact with one another. In the basic SIR example that we covered in the first two tutorials, we used a 'random' contact network, which creates random pairings of people. Generally speaking, the structure of network that you use depends on what disease you're modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starsim contains two different approaches to disease transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contact network:** Disease transmits on individual person-to-person relationships. These are networks in the sense that each agent (person) can be viewed as a node and each contact is an edge. Networks are undirected in the sense that an edge will allow transmission in both directions, however you can make transmission stronger one way (p1-->p2) than the other (p2-->p1). The framework includes several pre-built contact network algorithms, each of which manages a list of edges that can change on each simulation step. In addition to the 'random' network, the framework include algorithms representing basic sexual networks for modeling sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and a 'maternal' network for modeling mother-to-child transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mixing pools:** Simulate well-mixed transmission from one group of agents to another. Each mixing pool simulates directed transmission from a group of source agents to a group of destination agents. Instead of simulating individual edges like in a contact network, mixing pools first compute the total \"contagion\" that is shed by the source group. This total contagion value is normalized by the number of agents in the source group to arrive at a value that represents a typical infectious source agent. Then, each destination agent is exposed to this typical (average) infectious agent, likely resulting in new infections in the destination group. Multiple mixing pools can be run simultaneously to simulate heterogeneous transmission between various source and destination groups. Mixing pools could be used with age contact matrices like those developed by Prem et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that contact networks and mixing pools can be used together in a single simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate a couple of the built-in contact networks, and give an overview of how you might create your own for your own disease modeling work. We'll also demonstrate how to use mixing pools."
