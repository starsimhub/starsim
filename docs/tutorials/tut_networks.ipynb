    "Many infectious diseases transmit when people come into contact with one another. In the basic SIR example that we covered in the first two tutorials, we used a 'random' contact network, which creates random pairings of people. Generally speaking, the structure of network that you use depends on what disease you're modeling. In addition to the 'random' network, Starim contains some basic sexual networks for modeling sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and a 'maternal' network for modeling mother-to-child transmission.  \n",

    "In this tutorial, we'll demonstrate a couple of the built-in networks, and give an overview of how you might create your own for your own disease modeling work."

    "Starsim's networks are stored in the `networks.py` file. At the top of this file you'll see the `Network` class, which provides the template for all the other networks. At a high level, all you need to know is that network stores various *parameters* that determine how pairs of people form and dissolve, and a collection of all the *contacts* that exist at a given point in time. Let's look at a simple example of the `random` network:"
