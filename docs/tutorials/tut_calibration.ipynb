    "Disease models typically require contextualization to a relevant setting of interest prior to addressing \"what-if\" scenario questions. The process of tuning model input parameters so that model outputs match observed data is known as calibration. There are many approaches to model calibration, ranging from manual tuning to fully Bayesian methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many applications, we have found that an optimization-based approach is sufficient. Such methods avoid the tedious process of manual tuning and are less computationally expensive than fully Bayesian methods. One such optimization-based approach is the Optuna library, which is a Bayesian hyperparameter optimization framework. Optuna is designed for tuning hyperparameters of machine learning models, but it can also be used to calibrate disease models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calibration libraries often treat the disease model as a black box, where the input parameters are the \"hyperparameters\" to be tuned. The calibration process is often iterative and requires a combination of expert knowledge and computational tools. The optimization algorithm iteratively chooses new parameter values to evaluate, and the model is run with these values to generate outputs. The outputs are compared to observed data, and a loss function is calculated to quantify the difference between the model outputs and the observed data. The optimization algorithm then uses this loss function to update its search strategy and choose new parameter values to evaluate. This process continues until the algorithm converges to a set of parameter values that minimize the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "While many optimization algorithms are available, Starsim has a built-in interface to the Optuna library, which we will demonstrate in this tutorial. We will use a simple Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model as an example. We will tune three input parameters, the infectivity parameter, `beta`, the initial prevalence parameter, `init_prev`, and the Poisson-distributed degree distribution parameter, `n_contacts`. We will calibrate the model using a beta-binomial likelihood function so as to match prevalence at three distinct time points."

    "The Starsim framework has been integrated with the Optuna hyperparameter optimization algorithm to facilitate calibration through the `Calibration` class. Recall that an optimization-based approach to calibration minimizes a function of the input parameters. This function is key to achieving an acceptable calibration.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to describe the goodness-of-fit function for the `Calibration`. The first method is to directly provide a function that the algorithm will call. The `eval_fn` will be passed each completed `sim` after running, and is expected to return a float representing the goodness of fit (higher is better). Data can be passed into the `eval_fn` via `eval_kwargs`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative to directly specifying the evaluation function, you can use `CalibComponent`s. Each component includes real data, for example from a survey, that is compared against simulation data from the model. Several components and be used at the same time, for example one for disease prevalence and another for treatment coverage. Each component computes a likelihood of the data given the input parameters, as assess via simulation. Components are combined assuming independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining a `CalibComponent`, we give it a `name` and pass in `expected` (the real data to be calibrated to). The required data fields depend on the likelihood function. Importantly, the functional form of the negative log likelihood, or nll, is defined by the `nll_fn`. The value for `nll_fn` can be `'beta'`, `'gamma'`, or a negative log likelihood function of your own creation. If designing your own function for `nll_fn`, it should take two arguments: `expected` and `actual`. For a beta binomial, the data must define `n` and `x`, where `n` is the number of individuals who were sampled and `x` is the number that were found, e.g. identified as positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Output from the simulation is obtained via a function. The function takes a completed `sim` object as input and returns a dictionary with fields as required for the evaluation function of your choice. In the example below, we use an in-line lambda function to extract `n` and `x` from the simulation, as required by the Beta binomial component.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each component has a `weight`. The final goodness of fit is a weighted sum of negative log likelihoods.\n",

    "Finally, the `conform` argument describes how the simulation output is adjusted to align with the real data. For example, if the real data is a prevalence measurement, choosing `'prevalent'` will interpolate the simulation output at the time points of the real data. Choosing `'incident'`, the simulation output will be aggregated between time points of the real data."
