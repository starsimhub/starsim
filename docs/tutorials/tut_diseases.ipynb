    "Diseases are the cornerstone of almost any Starsim analysis. This is where you add details about what disease you are modeling, including transmissibility, natural history, and mortality outcomes.      \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE 1: The version of Starsim was originally conceived as a model for co-circulating STIs, and the current version of the codebase has much more developed models of STIs (including syphilis and HIV) than it does for other pathogens. However, the library of available diseases will keep expanding with time, and we will update these tutorials as it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE 2: Starsim descended from a family of similar agent-based models that share common architecture and design principles: [Covasim](https://covasim.org/), [HPVsim](https://hpvsim.org/), and [FPsim](https://fpsim.org/). If you are especially interested in modeling COVID-19, HPV and cervical cancer, or family planning, you may be better off using one of these pre-existing models. For all other diseases/health conditions, Starsim is probably your best bet.\n"
