However, the library of available diseases will keep expanding with time, and we will update these tutorials as it does.\n",

If you are especially interested in modeling COVID-19, HPV and cervical cancer, or family planning, you may be better off using one of these pre-existing models. For all other diseases/health conditions, Starsim is probably your best bet.\n"

    "## Adding multiple diseases\n",
    "You can add multiple diseases to the same simulation, like so. Here we are making use of a \"connector\". A connector is a module in Starsim that tells you how two things relate to one another - in this case, how HIV modifies a person's transmissibility and susceptibility to gonorrhea and vice versa. Unlike dieases, networks, interventions, etc., connectors don't have any pre-specified location in the sim. Instead, they can be placed wherever they make the most sense (for example, a connector that mediated how two networks behaved might be placed at the beginning or end of the list of networks; for diseases, it might be placed at the beginning or end of the list of diseases)."
