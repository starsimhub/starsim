    "Starsim is a highly flexible framework for creating agent-based models. Starsim was designed by a team with expertise in infectious diseases, so many of the examples that we'll cover throughout these tutorials are examples of infectious diseases. However, you can also use Starsim for modeling other things, like non-communicable diseases (NCDs) or family planning and maternal health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installing and getting started with Starsim is quite simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "To install, just type `pip install starsim`. If it worked, you should be able to import Starsim with `import starsim as ss`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic design philosophy of Starsim is: **common tasks should be simple**. Since Starsim is most commonly used for modeling infectious diseases, everything related to that should be straightforward. The most common tasks that you are likely to do are:\n",

    "- Defining parameters\n",
    "- Running a simulation\n",
    "- Plotting results\n",
