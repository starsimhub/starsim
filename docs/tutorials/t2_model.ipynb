    "# T2 - Building your model\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to introduce you to the idea of _model components_. In brief, these are: people, demographics, networks, diseases, interventions, analyzers, and connectors. Within Starsim, these are the ingredients of a model. On a more basic level, you can think of these as the ingredients of an epidemic. Because Starsim is intended to be very modular, you can build up all these things independently and then piece them together to make a model. Or, if that's too complex for your needs, there are also shortcuts you can take to make life simpler!\n",

    "2. Whether an epidemic 'takes off' depends to a large extent on the [basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number), which is the expected number of cases that an infected individual generates. In an agent based model like the one we've created here, that depends largely on three things: `beta` (the transmissibility parameter for the disease), `n_contacts` (the number of contacts each person has), and `dur_inf` (another disease-related parameter that determines the duration of infection). Experiment with different values for each of these and compare the trajectory of `sim.results.sir.n_infected` with different parameter values.\n"
