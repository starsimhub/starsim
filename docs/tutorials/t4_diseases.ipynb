    "You can add multiple diseases to the same simulation, like so. Here we are making use of a \"connector\". A connector is a module in Starsim that tells you how two things relate to one another - in this case, how HIV modifies a person's transmissibility and susceptibility to gonorrhea and vice versa. Unlike dieases, networks, interventions, etc., connectors don't have any pre-specified location in the sim. Instead, they can be placed wherever they make the most sense (for example, a connector that mediated how two networks behaved might be placed at the beginning or end of the list of networks; for diseases, it might be placed at the beginning or end of the list of diseases)."
