    "\n",
    "Much of Starsim's power comes from how it handles agents. However, agent-based modeling may be too slow or too complex for some problems. While in many cases it probably makes more sense to do compartmental disease modeling in another framework (such as [Atomica](https://atomica.tools/)), it is also possible to do it within Starsim, taking advantage of features such as demographics, time units, etc. This is especially useful for a multi-disease simulation where some diseases need the detail and flexibility of an ABM, while others can be modeled more simply (and faster) as compartmental models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will define a simple compartmental susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model. The model definition here is quite similar to the agent-based implementation in Starsim's [SIR module](https://github.com/starsimhub/starsim/blob/main/starsim/diseases/sir.py); differences are noted in comments. Note that the model runs extremely fast, since a three-state compartmental model (susceptible, infecious, and immunity) runs as fast as an agent-based model with three agents!"
