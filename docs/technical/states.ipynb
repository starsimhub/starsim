    "The `State` class and related architecture in _Starsim_ supports three key features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ability to add and remove agents during a simulation, to enable simulation of births, and increase simulation performance by removing unused agents (e.g., due to death or emigration)\n",
    "- The ability to access the states of agents by their UID rather than array index (because the array indices may change as agents are removed from simulations)\n",
    "- The ability to distribute states across different modules and components of the model. For example, interventions and networks can define states for attributes such as vaccination status or age of debut, and have them dynamically grow and shrink the same as states stored inside a `People` object\n",
    "\n",
    "Compared to previous models such as _Covasim_ and _HPVsim_, the distribution of agent state throught a simulation means that the `People` object should no longer be thought of as a central 'repository' of all of the states associated with agents. Rather, it is a container for demographic states and other attributes that are common to agents across all modules. That is, the `People` object provides primary storage for attributes such as age and sex, whereas module specific attributes (such as susceptible, infectious, vaccinated) are stored within their respective modules. It is of course possible to store references to states across a simulation, and indeed for convenience references to the states associated with disease modules are automatically added to the `People` object. However, it is important to keep in mind that there are are still other states outside of the `People` instance, that are accessed via their respective modules. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "A common use pattern is to store references to modules to faciliate access to specific states. For example, an intervention could store a reference to a disease module, so that vaccine eligibility at each timestep can be checked against infection history. In fact, a module can directly store references to other `State` instances. In the same way that the `People` object contains references to disease states, an `Intervention` could directly reference `States` within a disease. Therefore, an intervention can be linked to a network, disease, or other module by passing that module to the intervention's constructor as part of creation/initialization. This allows binding the module to specific states without having to access them via a `People` instance.\n",
