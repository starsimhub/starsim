    "Agent-based models draw random numbers from distributions to simulate various phenomena. Realizations (also called draws or samples) from distributions are used to model everything from the duration of each infection to the number of contacts each individual has in a network to the outcomes of individual diagnostic tests. The Starsim framework includes state of the art functionality for specifying and sampling from statistical distributions.\n",
