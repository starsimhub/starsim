    "The Starsim framework implements a novel approach to sampling from distributions that prevents random noise from corrupting differences between two simulations. This user guide will demonstrate how to use the common random number (CRN) feature to achieve low-variance differences in simulation results.

    "## Understanding Common Random Numbers (CRN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Random Numbers (CRN) is a technique pioneered within the Starsim Framework for reducing the variance between two simulations. This method enables noise-free accounting of the effects of different parameters or interventions on outcomes like infections averted or lives saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand CRN, you first have to know a little about where random numbers come from. As discussed in the [Advanced Distribution User Guide](advanced_distributions.ipynb), random numbers are used to make stochastic decisions within the model. Individuals realizations are generated from a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) using a user-specified seed. The PRNG produces a sequence of numbers that appear random but are actually deterministic, meaning that the same seed will always produce the same sequence of numbers. Here is a simple demonstration using the `numpy` library:"

    "### The problem solved by CRN in Agent-Based Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Most agent-based modeling frameworks dole out random numbers to agents sequentially, as needed, drawing values from a single centralized random number generator. The problem arises when you want to compare two similar, but different simulations. Even if the two simulations are run with the same seed, the difference in outcomes will be a combination of 1) real and meaningful \"mechanistic\" differences caused by the different inputs, and 2) random number noise caused by \"stochastic branching.\" Stochastic branching is just a technical term used to describe which random numbers are used to make each decision.  The random number noise obscures the real differences, making it difficult to determine the true impact of the changes made in the second simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simple example, consider the following two simulations of a Fishing module.\n",
    "- Simulation A has 20 agents who are trying to catch fish. On each time step, each agent has a 50% chance of going fishing, and a 20% chance of catching a fish if they go fishing.\n",
    "- Simulation B is identical to Simulation A, except that agent 0 is banned from fishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both simulations will use the same random number seed. Because the agents do not interact (they're not competing for the same fish!), the only difference in outcomes should be that agent 0 does not go fishing and therefore will never catch a fish. However, because of the way random numbers are generated, the two simulations will use different random numbers to make their decisions. This means that banning agent 0 from fishing will _change which other agents go fishing and catch fish_!\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** We have to specifically disable Starsim's CRN to observe the problem that all other agent-based modeling frameworks face. To do that in Starsim, we set the `_centralized` option to `True` in this example."
