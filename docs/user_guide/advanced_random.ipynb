    "The Starsim framework implements a novel approach to sampling from distributions that prevents random number noise from corrupting differences between two simulations. This user guide will demonstrate how to use the common random number (CRN) feature to achieve low-variance differences in simulation results. This feature is important for scenario and sensitivity analyses, where the goal is to isolate the effects of specific changes in model parameters or configurations. \n",

    "\n",
    "Common Random Numbers (CRN) is a sophisticated technique that enables noise-free accounting of the effects of different parameters or interventions on outcomes like infections averted or lives saved. Starsim is the first and only simulation framework that fully supports CRN, including agent-agent interactions like disease transmission and vital dynamics including births.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand CRN, you first have to know a little about where random numbers come from. As discussed in the [Advanced Distributions guide](advanced_distributions.ipynb), random numbers are used to make stochastic decisions within the model. Individuals realizations are generated from a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) using a user-specified seed. The PRNG produces a sequence of numbers that appear random but are actually deterministic, meaning that the same seed will always produce the same sequence of numbers. Here is a simple demonstration using the `numpy` library:"

    "### The problem solved by CRN in agent-based simulation modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Most agent-based modeling frameworks dole out random numbers to agents sequentially, as needed, drawing values from a single centralized random number generator. The problem arises when you want to compare two similar, but different simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if the two simulations are run with the same seed, the difference in outcomes will be a combination of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Real and meaningful \"mechanistic\" differences caused by the different inputs, and\n",
    "2. Random number noise caused by \"stochastic branching.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Stochastic branching is just a technical term used to describe which random numbers are used to make each decision.  The random number noise obscures the real differences, making it difficult to determine the true impact of the changes made in the second simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of stochastic branching: Fishing ðŸŽ£\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simple example, consider the following two simulations of a Fishing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulation A has 20 agents who are trying to catch fish. On each time step, each agent has a 50% chance of going fishing, and a 20% chance of catching a fish if they go fishing.\n",
    "- Simulation B is identical to Simulation A, except that agent 0 is banned from fishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both simulations will use the same random number seed. Because the agents do not interact (they're not actually competing for the same fish!), the only difference in outcomes should be that agent 0 does not go fishing and therefore will never catch a fish. However, because of the way random numbers are generated, the two simulations will use the same random numbers for different purposes. This means that banning agent 0 from fishing will _change which other agents go fishing and catch fish_!\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** We have to specifically disable Starsim's CRN to observe the problem that all other agent-based modeling frameworks face. To do that in Starsim, we set the `single_rng` option to `True` in this example."

    "This advanced CRN functionality is built into every distribution in Starsim! You will automatically get the benefits of CRN whenever you properly use distributions in your modules. Here are a few tips to ensure proper usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use a separate distribution for each \"decision\" in your code. Ideally, each distribution would only be called one time per time step.\n",
    "2. Create each distribution one time per module. The `__init__` method is a great place to do this. Do not create a new distribution on every step.\n",
    "3. When sampling from a distribution, pass `uids` or a boolean mask with length equal to the number of agents in the simulation. This ensures that each agent gets the right random number.\n",
