    "# What is Starsim?\n",
    "\n",
    "Starsim is a framework for modeling the spread of diseases among agents via dynamic transmission networks. Starsim supports:\n",
    "* Co-transmission of multiple diseases at once, capturing how they interact biologically and behaviorally\n",
    "* Non-infectious diseases, either on their own or as factors affecting the transmission or mortality of infectious diseases\n",
    "* Detailed modeling of mother-child relationships starting from conception, allowing investigation of infant and childhood diseases\n",
    "* Multiple types of transmission network, including theoretical (e.g. Erdős–Rényi) and realistic (e.g. age-assortative sexual partnerships)\n",
    "* Different intervention types, such as vaccines or treatments, and showing their impact through different delivery methods such as mass campaigns or targeted outreach\n",
    "* Automated calibration to data, plus careful handling of random numbers to minimize variance between simulations\n",
    "\n",
    "Starsim is available for both Python and R, and is fully open-source under the MIT license.\n",
