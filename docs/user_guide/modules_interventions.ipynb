    "\n",
    "This guide describes how to implementing interventions in Starsim. Interventions represent actions that affect disease transmission, such as screening, treatment, and vaccination programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For learning-oriented content on interventions, see [Tutorial 6 - Interventions](../tutorials/t6_interventions.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison of intervention classes\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base classes\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class | Purpose | Key features |\n",
    "|-------|---------|--------------|\n",
    "| `Intervention` | Base intervention class | Eligibility checking, product integration, step() method |\n",
    "| `RoutineDelivery` | Continuous delivery over time | Interpolated probabilities, annual/timestep rates |\n",
    "| `CampaignDelivery` | One-off or discrete campaigns | Specific years, optional interpolation |\n",
    "| `BaseTest` | Base for screening/triage | Product administration, outcome tracking |\n",
    "| `BaseScreening` | Screening programs | Population-level eligibility checking |\n",
    "| `BaseTriage` | Triage/follow-up testing | Targeted eligibility (e.g., screen positives) |\n",
    "| `BaseTreatment` | Treatment interventions | Queue management, eligibility validation |\n",
    "| `BaseVaccination` | Vaccination programs | Dose tracking, vaccination state management |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Screening interventions\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class | Delivery pattern | Use case |\n",
    "|-------|------------------|----------|\n",
    "| `routine_screening` | Continuous | Regular screening programs (e.g., annual STI screening) |\n",
    "| `campaign_screening` | Discrete | Mass screening events (e.g., outbreak response) |\n",
    "| `routine_triage` | Continuous | Follow-up testing for positives |\n",
    "| `campaign_triage` | Discrete | Campaign-based confirmatory testing |\n",

    "### Treatment interventions\n",
    "\n",
    "| Class | Capacity Model | Use Case |\n",
    "|-------|----------------|----------|\n",

    "| Class | Delivery Pattern | Use Case |\n",

    "\n",
    "### Eligibility functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Interventions use eligibility functions to determine who can receive the intervention:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Lambda functions for simple eligibility\n",
    "eligible_adults = lambda sim: (sim.people.age >= 18).uids\n",
    "\n",
    "# More complex eligibility combining multiple conditions  \n",
    "def high_risk_eligibility(sim):\n",
    "    adults = sim.people.age >= 18\n",
    "    sexually_active = sim.networks.mfnet.participant\n",
    "    return (adults & sexually_active).uids\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using intervention outcomes for triage\n",
    "screen_positives = lambda sim: sim.interventions.screening.outcomes['positive']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Product integration\n",
    "\n",
    "Interventions work with products that define the actual medical intervention:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using built-in products\n",
    "screening = ss.routine_screening(\n",
    "    product='rpr',  # String reference to built-in product\n",
    "    prob=0.9,\n",
    "    start_year=2020\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using custom products\n",
    "my_vaccine = ss.sir_vaccine(efficacy=0.8)\n",
    "vaccination = ss.routine_vx(\n",
    "    product=my_vaccine,  # Product object\n",
    "    prob=0.6,\n",
