    "# People, States, and Arrays\n",
    "Starsim is a framework for creating agent-based models, and the `People` class is where we store the agents, so it should come as no surprise that this class serves as the fundamental heart of any Starsim model. In this page we provide alternative pathways for creating people and some guidance on how to adapt these workflows depending on your needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "We start by giving an overview on this page of Starsim's custom `Arr` (array) classes, which are a separate but related Starsim class designed to neatly track data about people. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Starsim States and Arrays\n",
    "Starsim has a set of custom array classes for recording information about each agent in the population. The two fundamental types of array for storing such infomation are the `BoolState` class, which is a Boolean array, and the `FloatArr` class, which stores numbers (we don't distinguish between floats and integers, so all numbers are stored in these arrays). Each of these is a subclass of the Starsim `Arr` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Arr` class in Starsim is optimized for three key tasks that are common to almost all Starsim models: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Dynamic growth*: as the population grows over time, the size of the arrays dynamically update in a way that avoids costly concatenation operations;\n",
    "2. *Indexing*: over time, there are agents in the population who die. It is desirable for these agents to remain in the arrays so that we can continue to access data about them, but the indexing is set up so that dead agents are automatically excluded from most operations.\n",
    "3. *Stochastic states*: we often want to set the values of a state by sampling from a random variable (e.g. sex might be drawn as a Bernoulli random variable). Starsim's `Arr` class can be initialized with a random variables; we will provide examples of this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "All agents have a `uid` (universal identifier), which corresponds to their position in the array. Starsim keeps track of a list of `auids` (active UIDs), corresponding to agents who are alive or are otherwise participating in the simulation. This way, Starsim knows to skip over dead agents (or otherwise removed, e.g. from migration) when calculating disease progression, aging, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, you shouldn't need to worry about `uids`, `auids`, etc. However, this example illustrates how they work:"
