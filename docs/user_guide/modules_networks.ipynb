    "# Networks\n",

    "This guide provides technical reference for implementing and customizing networks in Starsim. For learning-oriented examples, see the Networks tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Transmission routes and the Route base class\n",
    "\n",
    "All disease transmission in Starsim occurs via **routes** - pathways through which infectious agents can spread. Both contact networks and mixing pools inherit from the base `ss.Route` class, which defines the interface for transmission mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Route hierarchy\n",
    "```\n",
    "ss.Route (base class for all transmission pathways)\n",
    "├── ss.Network (contact-based transmission)\n",
    "│   └── ss.DynamicNetwork (time-varying connections)\n",
    "│       └── ss.SexualNetwork (sexual partnership networks)\n",
    "└── ss.MixingPool (group-based transmission)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When diseases calculate transmission, they iterate through all routes in the simulation and call each route's transmission methods. This unified interface allows diseases to work seamlessly with any combination of networks and mixing pools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How transmission works via routes\n",
    "1. **Disease calls route**: Each disease loops through `sim.networks` (which contains all routes)\n",
    "2. **Route calculates transmission**: Each route computes new infections based on its transmission model\n",
    "3. **Route returns new cases**: UIDs of newly infected agents are returned to the disease\n",
    "4. **Disease processes infections**: The disease handles state changes and prognoses for new cases\n",
    "\n",
    "This separation allows you to mix and match different transmission mechanisms in a single simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Network architecture overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Contact networks inherit from `ss.Network` and manage collections of edges (connections between agents). All networks must implement methods for creating, updating, and removing connections between agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key network components:\n",
    "- **Edges**: The fundamental unit - connections between two agents with transmission parameters\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Network-specific settings that control connection behavior\n",
    "- **State management**: Tracking which agents can form connections\n",
    "- **Update methods**: Logic for adding/removing connections over time"
