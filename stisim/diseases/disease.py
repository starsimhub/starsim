    Record infections

    The infection log records transmission events and optionally other data
    associated with each transmission. Basic functionality is to track
    transmission with

    >>> Disease.log.append(source, target, t)

    Seed infections can be recorded with a source of `None`, although all infections
    should have a target and a time. Other data can be captured in the log, either at
    the time of creation, or later on. For example

    >>> Disease.log.append(source, target, t, network='msm')

    could be used by a module to track the network in which transmission took place.
    Modules can optionally add per-infection outcomes later as well, for example

    >>> Disease.log.add_data(source, t_dead=2024.25)

    This would be equivalent to having specified the data at the original time the log
    entry was created - however, it is more useful for tracking events that may or may
    not occur after the infection and could be modified by interventions (e.g., tracking
    diagnosis, treatment, notification etc.)

    A table of outcomes can be returned using `InfectionLog.line_list()`
