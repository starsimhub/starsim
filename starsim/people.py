        External-facing function to request an agent die at the current timestep

        interactions between modules (e.g., if a module requesting a future death, overwrites
        death due to a different module taking place at the current timestep).

        Modules that have a future time of death (e.g., due to disease duration) should keep
        track of that internally. When the module is ready to cause the agent to die, it should
        call this method, and can update its own results for the cause of death. This way, if
        multiple modules request death on the same day, they can each record a death due to their
        own cause.

        The actual deaths are resolved after modules have all run, but before analyzers. That way,
